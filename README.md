# RollABall
This game is basically a hello world for game development in Unity. This tutorial showed how to set up the scene, add objects, move objects, handle collisions, keep score and end the game. 

I don't own the game assets or the game idea. I am just trying to put this project here to showcase my skills. As i learn more and more i will put tutorials here in github but i aim to release my own games made in unity eventually. 

I have created this final output after following along with the official Unity tutorial on page https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial. Please look at the offical unity license for this course but i found this somewhere "All assets including models, textures, sounds and scripts are available for free commercial and non-commercial use when used in a Unity game."

You can view more details at my personal blog here [http://www.jawadrashid.com/roll-a-ball/](http://www.jawadrashid.com/roll-a-ball/) and view the working demo of the app here [https://jawadrashid2011.github.io/RollABall/Builds/Web%20GL/](https://jawadrashid2011.github.io/RollABall/Builds/Web%20GL/)

You can find Web GL version and Windows version in releases section of this repository.
