# RollABall
I have created this final output after following along with the official Unity tutorial on page https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial. Please look at the offical unity license for this course but i found this somewhere "All assets including models, textures, sounds and scripts are available for free commercial and non-commercial use when used in a Unity game."

There is a build in builds folder for Windows platform.
